The `data` field is a list containing one or more trade objects. The server may combine consecutive trades with the same price and `bm` 
value into one aggregated item. Each trade object contains the following fields:

--------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 `seqnum` | `Long`     | the sequence number of the trade record. `seqnum` is always increasing for each symbol, but may not be consecutive 
 `p`      | `String`   | the executed price expressed as a string                                                       
 `q`      | `String`   | the aggregated traded amount expressed as string                                               
 `ts`     | `Long`     | the UTC timestamp in milliseconds of the first trade                                           
 `bm`     | `Boolean`  | if true, the buyer of the trade is the maker.
